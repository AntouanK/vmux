# VMUX on SocketStream

This is the old VMUX app built using the fantastic [SocketStream](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream) framework. The new version removes the SocketStream dependency because it doesn't suit anymore the goals of the project.

This code is **deprecated**. It's kept here for historic purposes and will probably be moved to a different repository in the future.
